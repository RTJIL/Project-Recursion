# Just Readme 
This project tackles two core algorithm challenges using both iterative and recursive methods in JavaScript: generating Fibonacci numbers and performing merge sort.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `fibonacci.js` – Contains both the iterative and recursive Fibonacci functions.
- `mergeSort.js` – Contains the recursive Merge Sort implementation.
- `README.md` – You're lookin' at it!

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 🌀 Recursion
- A function calling itself to solve smaller sub-problems.
- Key part of both `fibsRec` and `mergeSort`.

### 🔁 Iteration
- A loop-based approach for generating sequences.
- Used in `fibs`.

### 🧩 Merge Sort
- Divide and conquer strategy
- Base case: array length is 1 or 0
- Recursive case: split array ➝ sort halves ➝ merge back together
